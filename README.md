This program was built to help learn a new keyboard layout while using the standard QWERTY layout so as to be able to see what you're typing as it may differ between chosen setup and the one your keyboard is configured for. 

As of 0.1.0 it works on Linux and Windows with the source code if Python and libraries are installed.

I would like to add more layouts as needed, it currently is only setup for QWERTY and DVORAK.

A settings window to change the layout of the keys may also come later as it's currently setup for a Morroco MD770 keyboard which is a split keyboard and as such may have a different layout than normal keyboards. That will mot likely take place in 0.2.0 or even 1.0.0 depnding on what else gets added.
