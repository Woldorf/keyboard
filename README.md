This program was built to help learn a new keyboard layout while using the standard QWERTY layout so as to be able to see what you're typing as it may differ between chosen setup and the one your keyboard is configured for. 

Version 0.2.0 is now released, still not a full release though, still working on some of the other major features.

v0.2.0 brings a settings screen where you can create, size, and organize custom keyboard layouts and then they are available on the main selection screen for use.
