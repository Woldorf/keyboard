This program was built to help learn a new keyboard layout while using the standard QWERTY layout so as to be able to see what you're typing as it may differ between chosen setup and the one your keyboard is configured for. 

Version 0.2.0 is now released, still not a full release though, still working on some of the other major features.

v0.2.0 brings a settings screen where you can create, size, and organize custom keyboard layouts and then they are available on the main selection screen for use.

Future versions will add the feature to add the ability to delete any of the keyboards on the system, change the default colors, resize the keyboard window/keyboard, and setting some background images and color designs for the keyboards

I would like to make this compatable with MacOS although MacOS is particlular about what is able to manage keystrokes and it may need so be heavily redone to accomidate for MacOS though it will be released once it works
